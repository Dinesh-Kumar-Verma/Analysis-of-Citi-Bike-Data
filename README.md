# Analysis-of-Citi-Bike-Data
# Objective🎯
The objective of this Project is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story, or report and to find the answers related to rider, riding, bike, and Destination etc.
# Problem Statement ❓
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program.
